# Cloud Defend for Containers

[PLACEHOLDER FOR NOW]

Drift prevention for containers.

The Cloud Defend for Containers integration allows you to prevent and alert on container drift in your live deployments.

## Data streams

The Cloud Defend for Containers integration collects two type{s} of data streams: logs and metrics.

Log data streams collected by the {name} integration include {sample data stream(s)} and more. See more details in the [Logs](#logs-reference). -->
Metric data streams collected by the {name} integration include {sample data stream(s)} and more. See more details in the [Metrics](#metrics-reference). -->

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

<!--
	Optional: Other requirements including:
	* System compatibility
	* Supported versions of third-party products
	* Permissions needed
	* Anything else that could block a user from successfully using the integration
